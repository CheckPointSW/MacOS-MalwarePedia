CookieMiner is a malware that steals a userâ€™s sensitive data, opens a backdoor on infected machines and downloads and executes a cryptominer.
It is then able to do the following:
 - Steal cookies of Chrome and Safari browsers
 - Steal Usernames and Passwords stored in Chrome
 - Steal credit card credentials stored in Chrome (such as Visa, Mastercard and more)
 - Steal iPhone SMS messages if it was backup to iTunes
 - Download and install additional files to have a backdoor on the infected machine
 - Download and execute the cryptominer program.
