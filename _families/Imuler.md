Imuler is a backdoor that connects to a remote C&C server and enables an attacker to perform various commands on an infected system such as:
 - download and execute additional files.
 - collect system information and send it to the C&C.
 - capture screenshots and send them to the attacker.The first variant arrived inside a pdf file, but as far as is known was not found in the wild. Other variant appears as jpeg file, as by default on macOS file extention does not appear.Once a user clicks on the file thinking heâ€™ will see a large view of the picture, the malware, which is actually an application bundle, is executed.
