CoinTicker appears to be a legitimate program that displays information on cryptocurrency coins such as Bitcoin, Etherium, Ripple etc…

However, in the background the malware downloads and executes additional malware from the internet. CoinTicker downloads two additional back doors The first is a custom version of EggShell malware and the other is EvilOSX by using the curl command:

The additional downloaded malware will open a reverse shell connection to its Command & Control server. To persist with a system reboot, the malware creates a LaunchAgent “~/Library/LaunchAgents/.espl.plist” (note that the LaunchAgent file is hidden by default since its start with “.”) as it starts with the command “launchctl load”. This LaunchAgent is actually a payload to download and execute the backdoor:

As the additional malware was downloaded from github, the user and all its content no longer exists.
