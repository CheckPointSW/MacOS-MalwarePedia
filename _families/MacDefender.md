Also known as MacProtector, MacSecurity, MacShiled and others and discovered on 2011 by Intego, this is a rogue AntiVirus program (Fake AntiVirus) for macOS.
FakeAV is a program also known as ScareWare which displays false message alerts on the victim’s machine about threats/malwares found on their system. In order to remove the threat, the program asks the user to purchase a license for it.
