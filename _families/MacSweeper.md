MacSweeper is the first Rouge Application / Scamware found for the Mac Operating System. Similar to other rogue applications, MacSweeper disguises itself as a legitimateapplication that scans for problems on the victimâ€™s computer. It then shows false results that it found issues on the machine that need to be fixed/cleaned.

If the user wants to fix the issues, they will be notified that the free version of the software will not fix these problems and instead he will have to purchase the program to do so. Of course the problems it shows do not actually exist and paying for the program will not fix these non-existent problems either.
