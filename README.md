## About
With a massive growth in new malware and infections, macOS security awareness is now more important than ever. Yet many people believe that if they are using macOS they are safe and should not be concerned about getting infected. Even though malware for macOS is years behind Windows malware in the sense of sophistication, complexity and number of infections, macOS malware is becoming more sophisticated as time goes by. Furthermore, it uses more ways to infect, evade and abuse the macOS architecture to deliver malware, for example - using applications signed with legitimate Apple developer certificates to avoid detection.
