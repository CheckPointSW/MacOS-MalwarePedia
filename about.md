With a massive growth in new malware and infections, MacOS security awareness is now more important than ever, and yet many people believe that if they are using MacOS they are “safe” and should not be concerned about getting infected. Even though malware for MacOS is years behind Windows malware in the sense of sophistication, complexity, number of infections and more, MacOS malware is becoming more sophisticated as time goes by. Furthermore, it uses more ways to infect, evade and abuse the MacOS architecture to deliver malware such as applications signed with legitimate Apple developer certificates to avoid detection.

During the years, a lot of researchers were hunting for OS X malware. These researchers analyzed and wrote detailed analysis reports to raise awareness too. However, since there are not many available resources that collects all this information and puts it all in one place, this portal was written to collect and summarize all information about MacOS malware.

For credits and full analysis report, links are below each malware that will take you to the original reports where the information was taken from.

From time to time, this portal will be updated with new/old malware.
